prize ?? ---> price

initialHealth and initialPrice --> affect Market buyArmy and buyEquipment
make EquipmentRegistry
for health speed etc use +/- : eg: health = +2, speed = -2

upon buying armour if it already existing, then the existing one will be discarded. 
I haven't handle that case. I mentioned you already have one.
In character buying if that kind of character already existing I do the same.
Need to resolve.

Make equipment attribute of characters a arraylist.

Is there a method to display the current status of player and characters? Dispaly their attributes etc. That will be good. 
Then I can print that upon buying equipments and characters.

Maybe, instead of buy -> buyMenu -> buyArmy etc, We can show in the market menu 
    01. buy army 
    02. buy equipment
    03. sell army
    04. sell equipment etc.

br careful: file is "Armor" , not "Armour"
also "Artefacts", not "Artefact"

Maybe display items can be take into one function. that will shorten the code
