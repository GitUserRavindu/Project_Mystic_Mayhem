prize ?? ---> price

//NO NEED. RESTORE THEIR HEALTH AFTER BATTLE. initialHealth and initialPrice --> affect Market buyArmy and buyEquipment
// DONE. make EquipmentRegistry
for health speed etc use +/- : eg: health = +2, speed = -2

// SOLVED. upon buying armour if it already existing, then the existing one will be discarded. 
// SOLVED. I haven't handle that case. I mentioned you already have one.
// OK. SINCE SELL MENU DISPLAY AGAIN. In character buying if that kind of character already existing I do the same.

//SOLVED. Make equipment attribute of characters a arraylist.

Is there a method to display the current status of player and characters? Dispaly their attributes etc. That will be good. 
Then I can print that upon buying equipments and characters.

be careful: file is "Armor" , not "Armour"
also "Artefacts", not "Artefact"

Maybe add a confirm before buying, for other methods also, save/load etc

Add character type (Archer, Knight, etc) attribute. Then We can print it (after byuing character etc) 
e.g.    "You have.... bla bla  
            Archer : Shooter
            Knight : Squire ..."


// DONE. userId and xp changed to not static

Characters already equipped items should be displayed

            6. Market (buy, sell)                                                               - done (separate function)          
            7. Battle                                - done (separate function) - need opponent selection

// NO, THAT WILL AFFECT SAVE. Maybe add some static variables to gamesvamanager. Then in the main function we can call gamesavemanager class.
inside class, new object will create to save????
