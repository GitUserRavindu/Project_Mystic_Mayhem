prize ?? ---> price

initialHealth and initialPrice --> affect Market buyArmy and buyEquipment
make EquipmentRegistry
for health speed etc use +/- : eg: health = +2, speed = -2

upon buying armour if it already existing, then the existing one will be discarded. 
I haven't handle that case. I mentioned you already have one.
In character buying if that kind of character already existing I do the same.
Need to resolve.

Make equipment attribute of characters a arraylist.

Is there a method to display the current status of player and characters? Dispaly their attributes etc. That will be good. 
Then I can print that upon buying equipments and characters.

be careful: file is "Armor" , not "Armour"
also "Artefacts", not "Artefact"

Maybe add a confirm before buying

Add character type (Archer, Knight, etc) attribute. Then We can print it (after byuing character etc) 
e.g.    "You have.... bla bla  
            Archer : Shooter
            Knight : Squire ..."


userId and xp changed to not static

Characters already equipped items should be displayed

one scanner for whole program! Should I try it?

Sample : Main menu
            Create Profile (Make a new Player)
            Change Name
            Market (buy, sell)
            Own Status Check (Current attributes of player)
            Own Army characters check (Their equipments and details)
            Select player (There are many players. Users can select a player.)
            Battle
            Exit

Maybe add some static variables to gamesvamanager. Then in the main function we can call gamesavemanager class.
inside class, new object will create to save????

scanner.nextline problem? we can set while(choice.isEmpty()) { choice = scanner.nextLine()} ---> should do.

//DONE: need to create string homeground
